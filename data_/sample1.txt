i am going to visit Ravi, who is a doctor at Delhi Medical center, on the 29th of August. I am planning to stay with him for couple of weeks in his house which is at the diplomatic district.  I will meet Ravi, his family and other friends. We are planning to spend some time visiting historic sites in New Delhi and attending a wedding ceremony for Ravi's sister. First i confirmed the dates with Ravi, about the wedding and how much vacation he had. Secondly, I looked on expedia to find the best routes and price for my trip. Then i booked my flight to New Delhi using my credit card. To find the best price for my trip, there was longer flights with cheaper rates but i do prefer quick air trip.  To meet my old friends and be part of a happy event like a wedding. I also feel i will meet new people and have good relationship with them. The weather of New Delhi is something i am not looking forward. It is going to hot and humid. I do carry a tablet and i have few audio books on it, I am going to play them and wait for my journey to go ahead. Ravi is going to pick me up at the airport. Maybe eat and sleep after a long flight. Also, i am planning to go out and have some Delhi's famous tea. Take a day off, rest for a day. Catch up with all my emails and mail at home, Pay bills which are due, Review photos i took during my trip and get ready to go back to work.
